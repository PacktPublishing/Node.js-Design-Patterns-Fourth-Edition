# 01-pubsub-basic-chat

This sample demonstrates the Pub/Sub pattern by implementing a basic chat
application using WebSockets.

## Dependencies

This example requires you to install some third-party dependencies from npm.

If you have `pnpm` installed, you can do that with:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Alternatively, if you prefer to use another package manager, make sure to delete
the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file before using it.

If you want to use `npm`, you can run:

```bash
npm install
```

If you want to use `yarn`, you can run:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Run

To run the example server:

```bash
node index.js <port>
```

For example, to run the server on port 8080:

```bash
node index.js 8080
```

Then you can access the chat application by opening your browser and navigating
to:

```
http://localhost:8080
```
