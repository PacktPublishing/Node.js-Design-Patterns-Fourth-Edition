# 15-passthrough-late-piping

This example shows how to create and use a `PassThrough` stream for late writing
into a third party API accepting content from a stream. This is implemented here
through a web server that can receive files and store them locally.

## Dependencies

Install all necessary dependencies with:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Run

To run the example you have to start the server first:

```bash
node server.js
```

Then, in another terminal window you can run:

```bash
node upload-cli.js <path-to-file-to-upload>
```
