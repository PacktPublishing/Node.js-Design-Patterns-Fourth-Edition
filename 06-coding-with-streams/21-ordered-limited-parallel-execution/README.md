# 21-ordered-parallel-execution

This example shows how to create a limited parallel execution flow using
streams.

## Dependencies

This example requires you to install some third-party dependencies from npm.

If you have `pnpm` installed, you can do that with:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Alternatively, if you prefer to use another package manager, make sure to delete
the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file before using it.

If you want to use `npm`, you can run:

```bash
npm install
```

If you want to use `yarn`, you can run:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Run

You can run the example with:

```bash
node check-urls.js urls.txt
```

For a long list of urls you can alternatively use the `500urls.txt` file!

Then check the content of the results file with:

```bash
cat results.txt
```
