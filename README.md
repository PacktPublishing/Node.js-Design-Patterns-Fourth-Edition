Node.js underpins much of modern web development, reliably powering APIs and full-stack apps across all industries. Authors Luciano Mammino and Mario Casciaro offer a practical guide that unpacks the JavaScript runtime so you can write reliable, high-performance Node.js apps.
Building on the highly rated third edition, this new edition adds fresh case studies and the latest Node.js developments: newer APIs and libraries, ESM improvements, practical security and production tips, and guidance on using Node.js with TypeScript. It also introduces a new chapter on testing that gives you a full introduction to testing philosophy and practical guidance on writing unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, giving you the confidence to write functional, stable, and reliable code.
Real-world, end-to-end examples throughout the book show how to build microservices and distributed systems with Node.js, integrating production-proven technologies such as Redis, RabbitMQ, LevelDB, and ZeroMQ, the same components you’ll find in scalable deployments at companies of all sizes. End-of-chapter exercises consolidate your understanding.
By the end of this Node.js book, you’ll have the design patterns, mindset, and hands-on skills every serious Node.js professional needs to confidently architect robust, efficient, and maintainable applications.</details>

  <summary><h2>Requirements for this book</summary>
To experiment with the code, you will need a working installation of Node.js version 24 (or greater) and npm version 11 (or greater) or another package manager such as yarn or pnpm. If some examples will require you to use some extra tooling, these will be described accordingly in place. You will also need to be familiar with the command prompt, know how to install a package, and know how to run Node.js applications. Finally, you will need a text editor to work with the code and a modern web browser.
To get the most out of this book, you can download the example code files and the color images.
