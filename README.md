Node.js Design Patterns, Fourth Edition_published by Packt

The all the code examples in this repo are organised by chapter, for every
chapter you'll have multiple examples, each one with its own README and
`package.json`.

We are using `pnpm`, so you'll see `pnpm-lock.yaml` files for those examples
where you are expected to install dependencies. If you prefer to use other
package manages (such as `npm` or `yarn`), make sure to delete these files and
then install the dependencies with your package manager of choice.
