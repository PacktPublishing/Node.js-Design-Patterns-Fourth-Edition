# 11-adapter

This example shows how to use the adapter pattern to build an FS-like interface
that writes to level db instead

## Dependencies

This example requires you to install some third-party dependencies from npm.

If you have `pnpm` installed, you can do that with:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Alternatively, if you prefer to use another package manager, make sure to delete
the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file before using it.

If you want to use `npm`, you can run:

```bash
npm install
```

If you want to use `yarn`, you can run:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Run

You can run the example with:

```bash
node index.js
```
