# 01-strategy-multiformat-config

This sample shows how to use the Strategy pattern to create a configuration
manager that supports various file formats.

## Dependencies

This example requires you to install some third-party dependencies from npm.

If you have `pnpm` installed, you can do that with:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Alternatively, if you prefer to use another package manager, make sure to delete
the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file before using it.

If you want to use `npm`, you can run:

```bash
npm install
```

If you want to use `yarn`, you can run:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Run

> [!IMPORTANT]\
> This example uses TypeScript so make sure to have at least Node.js 23
> installed.

You can run the example with:

```bash
node index.ts
```
