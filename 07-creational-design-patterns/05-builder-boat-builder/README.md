# 05-builder-url-builder

This example demonstrate how to use the builder pattern to simplify the creation
of a Boat object.

## Run

To run the example launch:

```bash
node index.js
```

You can also have a look at an alternative using only TypeScript by looking at
the `nested-properties-config.ts` file.

If you want to execute this file you can run:

```bash
node --experimental-strip-types nested-properties-config.ts
```

or if you install `tsx`:

```bash
node --import tsx nested-properties-config.ts
```
