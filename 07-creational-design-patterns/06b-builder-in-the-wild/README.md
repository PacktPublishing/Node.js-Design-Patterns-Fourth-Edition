# 06b-builder-in-the-wild

This example contains a couple of usages of the builder pattern in the wild.

## Dependencies

This example requires you to install some third-party dependencies from npm.

If you have `pnpm` installed, you can do that with:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Alternatively, if you prefer to use another package manager, make sure to delete
the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file before using it.

If you want to use `npm`, you can run:

```bash
npm install
```

If you want to use `yarn`, you can run:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Run

To run the examples launch:

```bash
node superagent.js
```

and

```bash
node cli.js --separator "," "Hello, World"
```
