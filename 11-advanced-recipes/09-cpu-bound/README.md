# 09-cpu-bound

This sample demonstrates how to run a CPU-bound task in Node.js using
setImmediate or multiple processes.

## Run

To start the server, run:

```bash
node index.js
```

Then try to send one or more request to trigger the subset sum task:

```shell script
curl -G http://localhost:8000/subsetSum --data-urlencode "data=[116,119,101,101,-116,109,101,-105,-102,117,-115,-97,119,-116,-104,-105,115]" --data-urlencode "sum=0"
```

While a subset sum task is running, you can check the responsiveness of the
server with a command like this:

```shell script
curl -G http://localhost:8000
```

If the subset sum takes too long on your machine or is too fast for checking the
responsiveness of the server, try to reduce or increase the number of items of
the array given as input.

In the file `index.js`, try to swap between the various implementations of the
`SubsetSum` API to compare the differences in the responsiveness of the server.

```js
// index.js

// ...
//import { SubsetSum } from './subsetSum.js'
//import { SubsetSum } from './subsetSumDefer.js'
//import { SubsetSum } from './subsetSumFork.js'
//import { SubsetSum } from './subsetSumThreads.js'
```
